        Page Object Pattern in Ruby on Rails by <a href="https://github.com/amirci">Amir Barylko</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      Cucumber is a great tool to write features and help drive the BDD
      development cycle.
      However implementing the steps can be cumbersome and sometimes hard to write.
      </p>
      <p>
      Avoiding common "smells" and enforcing DRY and other good practices
      can be a challenge too!
      Abstraction is key and that is what the Page Object Pattern (POP) is about.
      </p>
      <p>
      POP helps us to avoid repetition and focus on what the application
      does, not the markup to implement it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Join me in a session where we explore the pattern, the benefits, and
      how to add it to our RoR applications with minimal effort and lots of
      gains!

        Testing by <a href="https://github.com/amirci">Amir Barylko</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      Test Driven Development is software development methodology based on "test first" approach.
      That means that before even writing a line of code we need to write a test for it.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Benefits of applying TDD include:</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>- Increase development confidence</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>- Improve quality of the code and use quality as a driver</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>- Regression testing at any point</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>- Automatic documentation</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>- Bring back the joy of coding!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      Have you ever wondered how to start? Do you have questions? This is your chance!
      <br />
      Join me on a session to discuss how to start with TDD, benefits of using it, drawbacks and why can be a life changing experience for you and your company. Your code will never be the same!

          If you use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> on a regular basis, you won't want to miss this one. Burke will be talking about git from the ground up - from what makes up a commit right down to the per-byte level. He will talk about how new commits are constructed from previous ones; what actually happens in merging and rebasing; how branches and tags are implemented; how syncing with remotes works; and what most of the contents of the .git directory is made of.

            ActiveMerchant 201 by <a href="http://burkelibbey.org/">Burke Libbey</a>
          </h3>

          <p> Payment processing is a crucial part of most web applications, but
          developers tend to be more afraid of it than necessary. Burke Libbey is going
          to show you how easy it can be to set up <a
            href="http://www.activemerchant.org/">ActiveMerchant</a> in Rails for credit
          card processing via one of ActiveMerchant's many supported gateways. Then,
          we'll cover how to interface with an unsupported payment gateway by writing a
          custom gateway driver. This talk will be 90% code. Come prepared, whatever that
          means to you.  </p>

          </h3>

          <p> Stefan is all to familiar with the potential unmaintainable spaghetti code

          briefly cover the evolution of JavaScript in the Rails environment, with a
          focus on the new <a
            href="http://guides.rails.info/3_0_release_notes.html">Rails 3</a> Un-obtrusive
          JavaScript drivers. Highlights will include, a Rails 3 UJS Primer, extending
          UJS, and using UJS without Rails 3 (O_o).  </p>
