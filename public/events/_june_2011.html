  Test Driven Development is software development methodology based on "test first" approach.
  That means that before even writing a line of code we need to write a test for it.

  <strong>Benefits of applying TDD include:</strong>
  <br />
  <strong>- Increase development confidence</strong>
  <br />
  <strong>- Improve quality of the code and use quality as a driver</strong>
  <br />
  <strong>- Regression testing at any point</strong>
  <br />
  <strong>- Automatic documentation</strong>
  <br />
  <strong>- Bring back the joy of coding!</strong>
