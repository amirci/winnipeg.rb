  Capybara is a gem that works as a complement of cucumber and aims to simplify writing acceptance tests for any web application. Out of the box provides a DSL that makes writing steps for common functionality like following links, clicking buttons, etc.
  It provides different drivers that can be configured and even chose per feature or scenario basis to indicate how we want to run that case. It has built-in support <a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-test">rack-test</a>, <a href="https://github.com/langalex/culerity">Culerity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jarib/celerity">Celerity</a> and <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>.
