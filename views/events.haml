    Monthly Event.
  
  %p
    Winnipeg.rb started out in February of 2010 as a weekly Hack Night. As much as we still enjoy our Hack nights consensus amongst us has been that we have enough interest in our city to run a monthly event for Ruby and related technologies. We are finally made it happen and hope that you can join us in contributing to its success!

    Understanding Git by <a href="http://github.com/thetamind">Matthew Boehlig</a>
  
  %p
    Does <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> control you? Using the basic set of commands you learned from a tutorial without really understanding what they are doing? Using git effectively requires the understanding of how to navigate the commit tree and manipulate branch pointers. Don't worry, it's not that scary. Matthew will shine a light on git's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> and show you how to practically use git in every day situations. No longer guess at which command to use, but really understand what's going on under the hood.
