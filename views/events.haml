    Monthly Event.

  %p
    Winnipeg.rb started out in February of 2010 as a weekly Hack Night. As much as we still enjoy our Hack nights consensus amongst us has been that we have enough interest in our city to run a monthly event for Ruby and related technologies. We finally made it happen and hope that you can join us in contributing to its success!

    Hack Night.

    Sometimes it's just fun to hang out with other developers while knocking out & discussing code over caffeinated beverages & tasty cafe food. From time-to-time we enjoy challenging each other with a good game of <a href="http://codegolf.com/">code golf</a>. We tentatively meet every 2nd or 3rd Thursday of every month from 7-9pm @ the <a href="http://www.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=93+Albert+Street,+Winnipeg,+MB+R3B+1G5&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=93+Albert+St,+Winnipeg,+Division+No.+11,+Manitoba+R3B+1H2&ll=49.898671,-97.140255&spn=0.007491,0.022724&z=16">Fyxx on Albert Street</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/winnipegrb">Watch Twitter</a> for when hack night comes together.

    For this event we're asking people like *you* in the audience to come up to the podium and talk about <strong>your favourite gem or plugin</strong> - think show and tell. Each person will be time-boxed to a strict 10 minutes - so keep things short and sweet! If want to get better at presentations / public speaking - this is a *fantastic opportunity* for you to improve even if you're just getting started with Ruby! Reserve your 10 minute spot before hand by emailing nathan_at_winnipegrb.org - we need at least 5 reserved spots to make this happen!
