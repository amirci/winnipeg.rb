    Monthly Event.
  
  %p
    Winnipeg.rb started out in February of 2010 as a weekly Hack Night. As much as we still enjoy our Hack nights consensus amongst us has been that we have enough interest in our city to run a monthly event for Ruby and related technologies. We are finally made it happen and hope that you can join us in contributing to its success!

    Hack Night.
  
  %p
    Sometimes it's just fun to hang out with other developers while knocking out & discussing code over caffeinated beverages & tasty cafe food. From time-to-time we enjoy challenging each other with a good game of <a href="http://codegolf.com/">code golf</a>. We tentatively meet every 2nd or 3rd Thursday of every month from 7-9pm @ the <a href="http://www.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=93+Albert+Street,+Winnipeg,+MB+R3B+1G5&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=93+Albert+St,+Winnipeg,+Division+No.+11,+Manitoba+R3B+1H2&ll=49.898671,-97.140255&spn=0.007491,0.022724&z=16">Fyxx on Albert Street</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/winnipegrb">Watch Twitter</a> for when hack night comes together.

    Do you want to build an iPhone application, but hate Objective-C? Do you hate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFK1cLhytY">Java</a>, but want to create something for Android? How do you feel about redoing all your work again, just to deploy to another platform?

    Crash Course in <a href="learnyousomeerlang.com">Erlang</a> Concurrency by <a href="https://github.com/erauqssidlroweht">Tim Herd</a>

    More and more scenarios call for massively concurrent applications. While most languages have facilities for concurrency, often times you have to worry about the implementation details. Threads, Locks and Mutexes. This talk will introduce you to <a href="learnyousomeerlang.com">Erlang</a>, a language designed from the ground up to handle concurrency.
