    Monthly Event.

  %p
    Winnipeg.rb started out in February of 2010 as a weekly Hack Night. As much as we still enjoy our Hack nights consensus amongst us has been that we have enough interest in our city to run a monthly event for Ruby and related technologies. We finally made it happen and hope that you can join us in contributing to its success!

    Hack Night.

  %p
    Sometimes it's just fun to hang out with other developers while knocking out & discussing code over caffeinated beverages & tasty cafe food. From time-to-time we enjoy challenging each other with a good game of <a href="http://codegolf.com/">code golf</a>. We tentatively meet every 2nd or 3rd Thursday of every month from 7-9pm @ the <a href="http://www.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=93+Albert+Street,+Winnipeg,+MB+R3B+1G5&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=93+Albert+St,+Winnipeg,+Division+No.+11,+Manitoba+R3B+1H2&ll=49.898671,-97.140255&spn=0.007491,0.022724&z=16">Fyxx on Albert Street</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/winnipegrb">Watch Twitter</a> for when hack night comes together.

    Testing Rails Applications by <a href="https://github.com/marcjeanson">Marc Jeanson</a>

  %p
    Ruby on Rails has fantastic support for Test Driven Development, but getting started can sometimes be overwhelming. This talk will cover:

    %ul
      %li - An introduction to BDD/TDD in a Rails context.
      %li - Popular testing gems and the testing stack that I like to use.
      %li - Testing "legacy" rails applications that do not have any tests (or poorly written ones).
      %li - Ways to speed up your tests.
      %li - Contineous Integration and why you should care about it.

  %p
    Whether you are new to TDD with Rails or a seasoned vet, come join in the discussion so we can all improve the quality of our applications.
