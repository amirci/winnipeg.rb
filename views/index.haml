            Learning Ruby by Reading the Source
            %span{:style => "opacity:0.7"} / Burke Libbey
          %p
            One of the best ways to learn a technology is to learn how it's implemented. People tend to view
            programming languages as black boxes, but there's a lot to be gained by exploring their
            implementations. Ruby is well-known for being a relatively complicated language with a lot of
            features that "just work", often employing "magic". The "it's magic" level of understanding can be
            surprisingly effective, but it will only get you so far. This talk explores a few bits of ruby's
            source to shed light on some of these less-obvious of ruby's features.
          %p
            This talk assumes a general, but not necessarily deep, understanding of ruby. It does involve
            some C code as well. You should understand what a pointer is, but past that, there will be
            plenty of diagrams to illustrate what's going on.
